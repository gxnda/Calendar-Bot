# Google-Calendar-Bot
Takes a calendar from Go4Schools and appends it to google calendar

WHEN LAUNCHING ON A NEW DEVICE\
Fetch credentials from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials \
- You will have to create a project and enable Google Calendar API\
\
Run main.py\
ALSO: doesn't work on Replit because Replit isn't locally run.\
\
Dependancies:\
CustomTKinter (pip install customtkinter)\
Google Calendar API (pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib)\
And I believe the rest are preinstalled to Python :)
